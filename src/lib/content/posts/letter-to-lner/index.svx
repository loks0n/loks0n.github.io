I have been a customer of LNER for a good few years, traveling between York and Newark. It's been pretty patchy service. Several canceled trains, and a bunch of late ones.

But my most recent experience has riled me up such that, at the moment, I'd rather crawl up the A1 with my shoelaces tied. 

I had booked the 16:46 train from Newark Northgate. I walked into the station cold and dishevelled, having travelled to the station via bus. The dreary winter days of January had come fast and without relief. My shivering knees stumbled onto the first LNER service that arrived at the station. 

Yet, the respite from the freezing temperature Newark air was short-lived. The ticket attendant began to reprimand me.

"That's not valid for this service!" He moaned.

Huh? Why? It's the same route. Almost the same price, more expensive in fact, in advance. Same operator. The same uninspiring red seats.

The attendant forced me to pay Â£15, which included a discount on the cost of my previous ticket. He presented this as a courtesy. It's not. I've already paid for this journey. I should get the money back!

If my sad journey is not refunded, I will take up cycling.

Very well LNER, 

You have forced my hand.
I will journey via bike henceforth.
