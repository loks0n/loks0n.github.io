Supposedly, making a public commitment to a goal can increase the likelihood of achieving it. Here's an attempt at harnessing this psychological trick.

During 2022, I'd like to:
- Wild camp overnight in the UK.
- Visit Kielder forest.
- Write a total of 12 posts on this blog.
- Bring the rewrite of <draughts.org> to feature parity with the existing site, and release it.
- Climb an entire set of red routes (V4-6) at the Depot Climbing Centre in Nottingham.
Do a muscle-up with good form.
