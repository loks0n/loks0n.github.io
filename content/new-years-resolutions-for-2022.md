Supposedly, making a public commitment to a goal can increase the likelihood of achieving it. Here's an attempt at harnessing this psychological trick.

During 2022, I'd like to:
- [ ] Wild camp overnight in the UK.
- [ ] Visit Kielder forest.
- [ ] Write a total of 12 posts on this blog.
- [ ] Bring the rewrite of <draughts.org> to feature parity with the existing site, and release it.
- [x] Climb an entire set of red routes (V3-5) at the Depot Climbing Centre in Nottingham.
- [ ] Do a muscle-up with good form.

These seem pretty easy. I could probably do all these in a month if a really got my act together. Maybe I will.
