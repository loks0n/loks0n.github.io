Wow. I didn't do great with these last year.
Ticked off a few, and then forgot about the rest. I did do some other cool stuff though so I'm not too fussed.

The trick is picking a few stuff I actually want to do.

During 2023, I'd like to:
- [2/6] Write a total of 6 posts on this blog.
- [ ] Do a muscle-up.
- [ ] Run the York Marathon faster than 3:45:00.

Woohooo! YEAH! 2023. OK! LET'S DO IT.
