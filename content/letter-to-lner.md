I have been a customer of LNER for a good few years; traveling between York and Newark. To be honest, it's been pretty patchy service, several canceled trains, and a bunch of late ones.

But my most recent experience has made me so averse to LNER that, at the moment, I'd rather crawl up the A1 with my shoelaces tied. 

I'd booked a train for 16:46 from Newark Northgate. Having got the bus to the station, I was already chilly, from the short winter days of January that were in full force. The clock showed 16:28 and my shivering knees prompted me to jump on the first LNER Edinburgh service that showed at the station. 

The respite from the cold Newark air was short-lived, however, as the ticket attendant would start to reprimand me.

"That's not valid for this service?" He bemoaned.

Why? It's the same route. Almost the same price, more expensive in fact, in advance. Same operator. The same royal red seats to remind me of the times I've sat on these trains, delayed for hours.

I was made to pay Â£15 which included a discount on the cost of my previous ticket. This was presented as a courtesy. It's not. I've already paid for this journey. I want the money back.

If this doesn't get an adequate resolution, I will probably take up cycling from destination to destination or something so I don't have to give you any more money.
